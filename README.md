This is the source code for my father's website, written in Ruby on Rails. Is was initially written in PHP six years ago,
and this new version is a work in progress.

It has a bunch of domain specific features, developed for his specific needs.

The website includes basic CMS features, with worpress-like shortcode support. It will include a file uploader for the
documents, pages, prevention_list and employee parts. It is tested with rspec and I try to keep a 100% coverage as much
as possible.

When I am working on it, I usually stream on twitch. You can subscribe to my [channel : twitch.tv/krolmkromm](http://www.twitch.tv/krolmkromm)
